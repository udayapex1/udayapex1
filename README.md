## ğŸ‘‹ Yo, I'm Uday Pareta

**Full Stack Dev (95% Backend / 5% CSS Hate)**  
I write code that moves data, spins servers, and spits out logs like poetry.  
Frontend is a compromise. Terminal is home.

No CSS tricks.
No animations.
No fake stats.

Just logs, logic, and low-level power.
If it needs a mouse, Iâ€™m already bored.
